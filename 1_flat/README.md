# Flat Python Script

The flat python script is suitable for the Python programs with the simplest structure.

Consider using this type when you want to do one "simple" thing with the program.

Examples:

- Making a plot with Matplotlib.

- Submit jobs / run programs / rename / convert file types in batches.

- Play with some Python libraries and try their features.

The `sjob` program we use on the cluster is written as a flat Python script.
