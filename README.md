# programing-tutorial

This tutorial covers the concept of python programming in three types:

1. Flat Python script

2. Python program with functions

3. Object-oriented Python project with classes

We will implement a molecular dynamics (MD) program using each of the above three type and discuss the best practices.

## MD Simulation Program Outline

1. Create a molecular system.

2. Setup force field.

3. Run simulation by integrating the equation of motion.

4. Analyze trajectory.
